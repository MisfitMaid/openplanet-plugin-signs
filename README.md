# Openplanet Plugin Signs

Ingame advertisements to add life to your maps and bring attention to your favorite plugins!

## Usage

The easiest way to use this site is to go to [https://misfitmaid.github.io/openplanet-plugin-signs/](https://misfitmaid.github.io/openplanet-plugin-signs/), find the sign you're looking for, and `right-click -> copy URL` it. However, if you want everything available locally, simply follow these instructions:

* Download and extract the [latest version](https://github.com/MisfitMaid/openplanet-plugin-signs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* For windows users, a convenient Powershell script, `CopyToTrackmaniaFolder.ps1`, exists to automatically copy these over to your Trackmania data folder. You might have to restart the game to see them appear in the ingame menu.
* For Linux users, you're enough of a nerd to read the powershell script and see that it's just some `cp` calls in a trenchcoat. Probably clone the repo instead and then make some symlinks!

## Contribution

Feel free to make a pull request adding signs for your plugins! If possible, please run `process.ps1` prior to submitting a PR (or replicate the functionality by adding a locator file and optimizing your png's)

Note that by contributing, you agree to release your signs to the public domain via [CC0-1.0](LICENSE.md).
